# Strategy Pattern for Simplifying Integration Tests in Django Rest Framework

## Overview
The Strategy pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows you to define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable. In the context of Django Rest Framework (DRF) Viewsets, the Strategy pattern can be used to simplify writing integration tests. This approach allows for better separation of concerns, making it easier to swap out testing strategies, reduce redundant code, and enhance the maintainability of your tests.


## How it Works
In DRF, Viewsets provide CRUD operations for model resources, and integration tests typically involve making HTTP requests to these viewsets and validating the responses. By applying the Strategy pattern, you can create separate strategies for testing different parts of your viewset (e.g., creating, retrieving, updating, deleting resources), and use a common interface to interact with them.

This structure allows you to easily modify or extend your test strategies without changing the rest of your test code.
